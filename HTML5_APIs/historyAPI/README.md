# Simple AJAX Web Server: 
I created 3 versions of a simple AJAX server using Node.js:


1) Vanilla JavaScript: [Full Demo Here](http://klammertime.github.io/businessReviewJSAJAX/)


2) Using jQuery: [App File](https://github.com/Klammertime/businessReviewJSAJAX/blob/master/js/appjQuery.js)


3) Using ES6 Promises: [App File](https://github.com/Klammertime/businessReviewJSAJAX/blob/master/js/appPromise.js)


The only difference between the 3 versions is the app.js file. However, to differentiate between them, I've named the last 2 versions based on the technology. 


This was created for JavaScript for Programmers at Foothills College.
