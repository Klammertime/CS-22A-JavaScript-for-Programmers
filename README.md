#CS 22A - JavaScript for Programmers

I am enrolled part-time at Foothill College for a Computer Science Associates Degree. I completed [JavaScript for Programmers](http://www.foothill.edu/schedule/outlines.php?act=1&rec_id=5825&Quarter=2016S) (5 units) in Fall 2015. The class assumed you had a solid programming background and was not intended for firsttime programmers. This online course provided two weekly lectures, a forum moderated by professor Rula Khayrallah along with weekly coding assignments which she both graded and reviewed.

In this course, we focused on the implemented features in **ECMAScript 6** and on **ECMAScript 5** and learned the differences where applicable. Since we were programming using ECMAScript 6, she had us use the Firebug console, since its already supports it.

###Some of the topics covered include:

* **JavaScript Basics & Best Practices** 
  * Primitives types vs objects and the introduction of primitive type **symbol** in ECMAScript 6. Operators, numbers including **Number.isNaN (ES6)**, the math library, falsy and truthy values, logical operators, strings and string methods (**new ES6 string methods such as includes, endsWith, startWith, and repeat**), character access, concatenation, and explicit type conversion. Best practices such as using strict mode, the strict equality operator, declaring variables, and using semicolons. 
* **JavaScript Control Structures**
  * The conditional operator, switch statements, how to avoid infinite loops, increment and decrement operators, shorthand operators, do ... while ... statements, for loops, and the introduction of the **let statement in ES6**.
* **Functions**
  * Default parameters for arguments introduced in ES6**, function definition expressions vs function declarations, **arrow functions in ES6)**, local vs global variables, nested functions and scope, declaring variables with a **let statement in ES6 allowing block scope**, variable and function **hoisting**, **recursion** and **closures**.
* **Objects & Properties**
  * Methods, prototypes, creating objects with constructors, 'this', inheritance, and hasOwnProperty(). New in ES6: symbols as property keys, shorthand notation for object literals where you emit the key, computed property keys, destructuring of objects, and classes which doesn't actually introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model but instead is built on top of existing prototype based inheritance.
* **Arrays**
  * Nested and sparse arrays, rearranging arrays using the reverse and sort methods, splice methods, push, pop, shift, unshift, forEach & map methods, for ... in & for ... loops, 

* **Sets and Maps**

* **JavaScript in the Browser**
* **Document Object Model**


* **Event Driven Programming**

* **Scripting Style**

* **Namespace Considerations**

* **Libraries & Frameworks**


* **Client Server Architecture**
* **Server-Side JavaScript**

* **JSON** 
  * How to perform **object serialization** using **JSON.stringify** to convert an object, array or a primitive value to a JSON formatted string, with the option of adding a **replacer** argument. 
  * How to parse JSON using **JSON.parse** in order to return an object, array or primitive value from a JSON string, with the option of using a **reviver** argument, transforming the parsed value before it is returned. 
  * How to make a **deep copy** of an array or any object by converting it to JSON then parsing it back. 

* **AJAX**

* **Promises**

* **Client-Side Storage**

* **HTML5 APIs**

* **The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern**

* **Web Application Design Considerations**


* **Test Driven Development (TDD)** 
  * We used Selenium, a browser automation tool commonly used for automating the testing of web applications. 

* **Mobile Platforms**
