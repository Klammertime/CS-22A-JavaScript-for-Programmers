#CS 22A - JavaScript for Programmers

I am enrolled part-time at Foothill College for a Computer Science Associates Degree. I completed [JavaScript for Programmers](http://www.foothill.edu/schedule/outlines.php?act=1&rec_id=5825&Quarter=2016S) (5 units) in Fall 2015. The class assumed you had a solid programming background and was not intended for firsttime programmers. This online course provided two weekly lectures, a forum moderated by professor Rula Khayrallah along with weekly coding assignments which she both graded and reviewed.

TODO: later add something like, for example, in this exercise, then link to that file and say whats happening?? Also, organize better, those hollow bullets?

In this course, we focused on the implemented features in **ECMAScript 6** and on **ECMAScript 5** and learned the differences where applicable. Since we were programming using ECMAScript, she had us use the Firebug console, since its already supports it.

Some of the topics covered include:

* **JavaScript Basics & Best Practices** 
  * Primitives types vs objects and the introduction of primitive type **symbol** in ECMAScript 6.
  * Operators, numbers including **Number.isNaN (ES6)**, the math library, falsy and truthy values, logical operators, strings and string methods (**new ES6 string methods such as includes, endsWith, startWith, and repeat**), character access, concatenation, and explicit type conversion. Best practices such as using strict mode, the strict equality operator, declaring variables, and using semicolons. 
*  **JavaScript Control Structures**
    * The conditional operator, switch statements, how to avoid infinite loops, increment and decrement operators, shorthand operators, do ... while ... statements, for loops, and the introduction of the **let statement in ES6**.
    
*  **Functions**

* **Test Driven Development (TDD)** 
  * We used Selenium, a browser automation tool commonly used for automating the testing of web applications. 

* **JSON** 
  * How to perform **object serialization** using **JSON.stringify** to convert an object, array or a primitive value to a JSON formatted string, with the option of adding a **replacer** argument. 
  * How to parse JSON using **JSON.parse** in order to return an object, array or primitive value from a JSON string, with the option of using a **reviver** argument, transforming the parsed value before it is returned. 
  * How to make a **deep copy** of an array or any object by converting it to JSON then parsing it back. 

* **Web Application Design Considerations**
* **Event Driven Programming**
* **Client Server Architecture**
*  **Sets and Maps**
*  **Server-Side JavaScript**
*  **JavaScript in the Browser**
*  **Namespace Considerations**
*  **AJAX**
*  **Mobile Platforms**
*  **Arrays**
*  **Libraries & Frameworks**
*  **The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern**
*  **Promises**
*  **Objects & Properties**
*  **Client-Side Storage**
*  **HTML5 APIs**
*  **Document Object Model**

*  **Scripting Style**
