#CS 22A - JavaScript for Programmers

I am enrolled part-time at Foothill College for a Computer Sciene Associates Degree. I completed JavaScript for Programmers (5 units) in Fall 2015. View the [course outline](http://www.foothill.edu/schedule/outlines.php?act=1&rec_id=5825&Quarter=2016S). 

According to the provided syllabus, 'This class assumes that you have a solid programming background. It is not intended for firsttime
programmers. You need to have taken either CS 1A, CS 2A, CS 3A or some equivalent course.'

The course provided lectures online, a forum moderated by professor Rula Khayrallah along with weekly assignments graded by the professor. Topics covered include:
TODO: later add something like, for example, in this exercise, then link to that file and say whats happening?? Also, organize better, those hollow bullets?
* **Test Driven Development (TDD)** - We used Selenium, a browser automation tool commonly used for automating the testing of web applications. 

* **JSON** - We learned the process of **object serialization** using **JSON.stringify** to convert an object, array or a primitive value to a JSON formatted string, with the option of adding a **replacer** argument. We learned how to parse JSON useing **JSON.parse** in order to return an object, array or primitive value from a JSON string, with the option of using a **reviver** argument, transforming the parsed value before it is returned. We learned how to make a deep copy of an array or any object by converting it to JSON then parsing it back.
